-- TreasuryHub Database Schema

-- Tables:

-- Organizations Table
-- Represents an organization workspace.
-- Each org is isolated; users can only access data within their org.
CREATE TABLE organizations (
    org_id      UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    org_name    TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

-- Users Table
-- Added this in with some starting fields, as it will need to be used for 
-- work with uploading/viewing files, as we will need to check users accessing 
-- files and create necessary restrictions. For now, left it with user_id, 
-- this will need to be expanded on further. This links to supabase built 
-- in auth table for users. 
-- See docs on this at https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/managing-user-data
-- except we would be using a public users table rather than "profiles"
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- Org Members Table
-- Added this in with some starting fields, may need
-- to be expanded on further. The role part is subject to change 
-- upon the addition of the Roles table which would add more flexibility for 
-- creating/managing roles

    role    TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('member', 'executive', 'advisor', 'treasury_team', 'treasurer'))
);

-- Transactions table
-- Added this in with some starting fields, as it will need to be used for 
-- work with uploading/viewing files, as these files should be able to link 
-- to transactions. For now, left it with just transaction_id and org_id, 
-- this will need to be expanded on
CREATE TABLE transactions (
    transaction_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    org_id         UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES organizations(org_id) ON DELETE CASCADE

-- Files Table

    file_id        UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
